# Certificate Workflows

## Issuance

```mermaid

    actor Admin
    participant UI as Next.js
    participant API as Spring Boot
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant Chain as CertificateRegistry
    participant Store as File storage
    participant Mail as SMTP

    Admin->>UI: Confirm issue draft
    UI->>API: POST /certificates/{id}/issue
    API->>DB: Lock draft, set ISSUING, persist hash + transaction journal
    API->>Chain: issueCertificate(key, hash, expiresAt)
    Chain-->>API: transaction hash
    API->>DB: Mark transaction SUBMITTED
    Chain-->>API: confirmed receipt + CertificateIssued event
    API->>DB: Mark transaction CONFIRMED and certificate ISSUED
    API->>Store: Generate QR and PDF
    API->>DB: Save PDF storage key
    API->>Mail: Send recipient notification
    API->>DB: Record delivery result
    API-->>UI: Issued certificate and blockchain metadata
```

Failure behavior:

- Validation or authorization failure stops before any chain call.
- A reverted or failed receipt sets the transaction to `FAILED` and certificate to `ISSUE_FAILED`; it is not public.
- A timeout remains `SUBMITTED`/`ISSUING` until reconciliation determines the receipt outcome.
- PDF failure leaves the immutable issuance intact and schedules artifact retry.
- Email failure leaves issuance intact and records a retryable delivery failure.

## Public verification

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Verifier
    participant UI as Next.js
    participant API as Spring Boot
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant Chain as CertificateRegistry

    Verifier->>UI: Enter ID or open QR URL
    UI->>API: GET /public/certificates/{certificateId}
    API->>DB: Load issued certificate and organization
    API->>API: Rebuild canonical data and SHA-256 hash
    API->>Chain: get/verify by deterministic key
    Chain-->>API: immutable proof and revocation state
    API->>API: Compare hashes and derive REVOKED > EXPIRED > VALID
    API-->>UI: Public fields, status, proof result, explorer metadata
    UI-->>Verifier: Accessible status card and details
```

The QR contains only `https://<frontend>/verify/<certificateId>`. An unavailable RPC produces a clear verification-unavailable state, not a false valid result.

## Revocation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Admin
    participant UI as Next.js
    participant API as Spring Boot
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant Chain as CertificateRegistry

    Admin->>UI: Enter reason and confirm
    UI->>API: POST /certificates/{id}/revoke
    API->>DB: Authorize owner, lock issued certificate, create REVOKE journal
    API->>Chain: revokeCertificate(key)
    Chain-->>API: confirmed receipt + CertificateRevoked event
    API->>DB: Store revocation transaction, time, and private reason
    API-->>UI: Status REVOKED
```
